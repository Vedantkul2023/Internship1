I first analyzed the task's objective, which was to create a well-structured database schema, including tables, relationships, and an ER diagram, and to provide the SQL script for it.
I selected E-commerce as it is a common and easy-to-understand example with clear entities and relationships.
I identified the core entities for an e-commerce system: Customers, Products, Orders, Order_Items, and Categories. I then defined the logical relationships between these entities 
For each of the identified entities, I wrote a CREATE TABLE SQL query. In these queries, I defined:
Column names: Such as customer_id, product_name, price.
Data types: I used appropriate data types like INT, VARCHAR, TEXT, DECIMAL, and TIMESTAMP.
Constraints: I added constraints like PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and AUTO_INCREMENT to ensure data integrity.
After creating the basic tables, I used ALTER TABLE statements to add FOREIGN KEY constraints. This is a crucial step to formally define the relationships between the tables, linking them together logically. For example, the customer_id in the Orders table was defined as a foreign key that references the customer_id in the Customers table.
I provided a textual representation of the ER diagram to visualize how the tables are connected through their primary and foreign keys. This helps in understanding the overall schema structure.
